This data set is clean enouph and I don't need to clean the data as normal.

Basic feature engineering on raw merged data:
```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(weeks_at_number_1 = as.integer(weeks_at_number_1),
         weeks_top_10 = as.integer(weeks_top_10),
         weeks_top_25 = as.integer(weeks_top_25),
         weeks_top_50 = as.integer(weeks_top_50),
         peak_position = as.integer(peak_position),
         bonus_weeks = as.integer(bonus_weeks),
         sub_points = as.integer(sub_points),
         peak_points = as.integer(peak_points),
         total_points = as.integer(total_points),
         peak_year = as.integer(peak_year),
         debut_date = as.integer(debut_date),
         debut_date = as.Date(debut_date, origin="1899-12-30"), 
         peak_date = as.integer(peak_date),
         peak_date = as.Date(peak_date, origin="1899-12-30"),
         weeks_to_reach_peak = as.integer(weeks_to_reach_peak),
         year=as.factor(year)
         )
```

In this chunk, I only need to make all of the column have right data type.

**Hint:** In the date part, because Excel save date by count the distance between the date and 1900-01-01, the date columns in the raw data are the days. I need to tranfer them to be the real date. The `origin` attribute shoule be 1900-01-01, but due to 1900-leap-year-bug of Excel, use 1899-12-30 can get right answer.
